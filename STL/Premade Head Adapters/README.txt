These are pre-made head adapters to fit the Janky Tape Echo.

A word of caution:

Cassette heads are very sensitive to being aligned to the tape path correctly. 3D prints have wide tolerances
that can be hard to get right at these small scales.

Because of this, you will need to be very careful to have your 3D printer tuned up for best possible dimensional
accuracy and to use a very high quality profile (lowest possible layer height and low speed printing) to ensure the head
adapter has the tightest tolerances.

3D prints tend to shrink, some filaments more than others, and so it's impossible for us to say these head adapters will work for
everybody - they are provided as an easy "try this first" route for people. It's quite possible you'll need to design your own
head adapter to work with your setup. Check out our build guide on our website for step-by-step instructions on how to do this with free CAD software.
