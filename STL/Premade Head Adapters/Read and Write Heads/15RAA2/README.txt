This is for 15RAA2 cassette head.

Print at highest detail possible to ensure dimensional accuracy. We print these on a Prusa Mini using the built-in Generic PLA filament profile at
0.05mm ULTRADETAIL, 15% infill in polyterra charcoal black PLA.

Space is provided around the right mounting hole (looking from the front of the head) for a spring (5mm length, 0.2mm wire, 2.5mm OD to allow pass through of M2 screw).
This allows for aziumth adjustment of the head, but is optional. If you are using the spring, place a M2 washer between the top of the spring and the underside of the head.
