# How can we support you?

Indifferent Engine is a band, so go check out our music here:
[spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0dltTUV2N49r1UjUTsqe3h?si=cdwmojcwTOmE14S_XvX_6A)

If you're having a crack at building an echo, maybe buy some parts from us on our [merch store](https://www.indifferentengine.com/shop).. All money goes back into the band for funding musical endeavours and more weird, open source pedal designs.
